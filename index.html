          React-Bootstrap is a complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap
          components using React. It has no dependency on either bootstrap.js or
          jQuery. If you have React setup and React-Bootstrap installed, you
          have everything you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methods and events using jQuery is done imperatively by directly
          manipulating the DOM. In contrast, React uses updates to the state to
          update the virtual DOM. In this way, React-Bootstrap provides a more
          reliable solution by incorporating Bootstrap functionality into
          React's virtual DOM. Below are a few examples of how React-Bootstrap
          components differ from Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages of Bootstrap Framework:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Responsive Design: Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system and a
            collection of pre-built components that automatically adapt to
            different screen sizes. This allows developers to create
            mobile-friendly websites and applications easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time-Saving: With ready-to-use components and templates, Bootstrap
            helps accelerate the development process. Developers can quickly
            create responsive layouts, navigation bars, forms, buttons, and
            more, without starting from scratch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Community and Documentation: Bootstrap has a large and active
            community of developers, which means there is extensive
            documentation, tutorials, and resources available. Developers can
            easily find answers to their questions or seek help from the
            community when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customization: Bootstrap offers a range of customization options,
            allowing developers to tailor the framework to their specific needs.
            They can customize the color scheme, layout, and components to match
            the branding and design requirements of their projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cross-Browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to be compatible
            with modern web browsers, ensuring consistent rendering and
            functionality across different platforms and devices.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Installation</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which
          you can install with npm (or yarn if you prefer).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want to
          use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to install vanilla
          Bootstrap as well.
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap</code></pre>

          <h2>Importing Components</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          You should import individual components like: react-bootstrap/Button
          rather than the entire library. Doing so pulls in only the specific
          components that you use, which can significantly reduce the amount of
          code you end up sending to the client.
        </p>
        <pre><code>import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';</code></pre>

        <header class="main-header">
          <h2>Examples</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          React-Bootstrap has started a repo with a few basic CodeSandbox
          examples. <a href="#">Click here</a> to check them out.

          <h2>Stylesheets</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Because React-Bootstrap doesn't depend on a very precise version of
          Bootstrap, we don't ship with any included CSS. However, some
          stylesheet is required to use these components.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <pre><code>{<br>/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */<br>}<br>import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';</code></pre>
        <p>
          How and which Bootstrap styles you include is up to you, but the
          simplest way is to include the latest styles from the CDN. A little
          more information about the benefits of using a CDN can be found
          <a href="#">here</a>.
        </p>
        <pre><code><<span>link</span><br>rel="stylesheet"<br>href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"<br>integrity="sha384-9ndCyUaIbzAi2FUVXJi0CjmCapSmO7SnpJef0486qhLnuZ2cdeRhO02iuK6FUUVM"<br>crossorigin="anonymous"<br>/></code></pre>
        <h3>SASS</h3>
        <p>
          In case you are using Sass the simplest way is to include the
          Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass files in your main Sass file and then require
          it on your src/index.js or App.js file. This applies to a typical
          create-react-app application in other use cases you might have to
          setup the bundler of your choice to compile Sass/SCSS stylesheets to
          CSS.
        </p>
        <pre><code>/* The following line can be included in a src/App.scss */<br>@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';</code></pre>
        <pre><code>/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */<br>import './App.scss';</code></pre>
